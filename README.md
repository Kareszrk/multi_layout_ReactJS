### How to start it?
Because I uploaded node_modules as well, after git clone you should just type [npm start] inside of the main folder.

### Why this repository exist?
Only because I wanted to save for myself this code. It is public because why wouldn't other people use it?

### Would you like to see it with an explanation?
This is the original source of the code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_umPvJyRVdg&t=848s
Warning: This isn't my video. This is the video I made this code by.
